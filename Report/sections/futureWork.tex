\section{Future Work}

The {\dhr} library does currently not support rules containing disjunctions. The listed Example program \ref{program with disjunction} should generate the output ''b'' or ''c'', with a choice point, for a given input of ''a''.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={chr program containing a disjunction}, label={program with disjunction}, frame=single]
a <=> b;c.
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Furthermore all the debugging facilities of the chr library are not currently implemented in {\dhr}.
It would be an important next step to implement debugging analogous to the chr library since {\dhr} aims to be a drop-in replacement.
Programs relying on, for example the \inlineCode{find_chr_constraint/1} predicate, to get the current constraint store would not work with the current version of the {\dhr} library.\\

\noindent Another area of future improvements is performance.
During the development of {\dhr} performance was not a main goal.
The functionality and proof-of-concept of implementing a CHR alternative using delimited continuation was the main focus of this work.
Therefore the current performance, especially for queries that prodce a large constraint store is far from optimal.\\
